## ✍️ Phase 3: Inline Comments & Narrative Clarity 💡

Code should speak for itself, but comments give the context. 🗣️

1.  **Explain the "Why"**: Don't just say *what* the code does; explain the *reason* for it. 🧠
2.  **Complex Logic**: Add a brief explanation for algorithms or non-obvious optimizations. 🧩
3.  **TODOs & FIXMEs**: Clearly mark areas for future improvement and assign tasks. 🛠️
4.  **Standard Formats**: Use JSDoc, KDoc, or Docstrings consistently. 📘
5.  **Deprecation Notices**: Warn users about functions that will be removed. ⚠️
6.  **Example Snippets**: Provide small, working examples of how to use a function. 💡
7.  **Side Effect Warnings**: Document any unexpected behaviors or state changes. 🕵️‍♂️
8.  **Performance Notes**: Mention if a function is expensive or heavy. ⏱️
9.  **Link to Docs**: Use @see or similar tags to link to external documentation. 🔗
10. **Visual Markers**: Use dividers or headers to organize large files. 📏

## 🌈 Jules' Documentation Philosophy 🧘‍♂️

-   **Think of the Newbie**: Write for someone who just joined the project today. 👶
-   **Keep it Simple**: Avoid overly technical jargon where possible. 🧊
-   **Show, Don't Just Tell**: Code snippets and diagrams are worth 1000 words. 🖼️
-   **Keep it Current**: Stale documentation is worse than no documentation. 🕰️
-   **Documentation is Code**: Treat your docs with the same care as your logic. 💻
-   **Searchability**: Structure docs so they are easy to search and find. 🔍
-   **Consistency is Key**: Use the same terminology throughout the project. 🤝
